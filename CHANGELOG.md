## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Bonus (โบนัส)** — new Research Specialist agent; 5th family member; calm and methodical younger brother of Phayu; tools: Read/Write/Bash/Glob/Grep/WebSearch/WebFetch; skill: planning-and-task-breakdown; output: structured markdown reports with sources
- **Git Worktrees pattern** — parallel agents run in isolated branches to prevent file conflicts; documented in CLAUDE.md
- **Shared Session State** — context/session-state.template.json; all agents read shared state before starting; Angpao writes task assignments; eliminates agents operating in isolation
- **Error Recovery** — spawn_agent() bash wrapper with configurable retry count; workflow survives agent failures
- **Structured Agent Output** — JSON summary block standard; every agent closes with { agent, taskId, status, filesChanged, summary, nextSteps }
- **Context Engineering** — dynamic prompt assembly injects session-state.json into each agent's prompt for cross-agent awareness
- **MCP per Role** — documented --mcp-config pattern; mcp-researcher.json.example for Bonus's web research tools
- **aw upgrade: self-update** — checks npm for newer package version and auto-updates before applying template

### Changed
- aw upgrade now self-updates the CLI package first (npm install -g), then applies the latest bundled template
- All team announcements and help text updated to include Bonus (5-member family)
- applyLanguageDirective now includes persona/researcher.md
